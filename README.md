# Tragic, the Gathering

### Background

Trading Card Games can be great fun, when played with friends of similar mindsets and with decks of similar power levels, but let's be real, even with all that, sometimes the game is absolutely not in your favour and sometimes...it's just tragic. Especially when you have to sort through thousands and thousands of cards. Here we are, gotta sort them at some point somehow...

### Next Steps

Planned future enhancements include using SPA to simply display the card by clicking on the name rather than requiring a different page to see the card.

Also on the list is the ability to choose whether you have a foil copy or not (this is half done but I couldn't stop getting errors in time), as well as the printing version, because of multiple versions from the same set such as this:
