# Tragic, the Gathering

### Background

Trading Card Games can be great fun, when played with friends of similar mindsets and with decks of similar power levels, but let's be real, even with all that, sometimes the game is absolutely not in your favour and sometimes...it's just tragic. Especially when you have to sort through thousands and thousands of cards. Here we are, gotta sort them at some point somehow...

Planned future enhancements include a MP4 animation as well as sound effects for when the user matches one or more numbers. 

Also maybe an animated progress bar for when the user rolls. The bar fills up from none to full through the roll.
